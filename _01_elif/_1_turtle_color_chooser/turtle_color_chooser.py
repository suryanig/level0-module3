    #         of code)
    #      3) Set the pen width to 10
    #      4) Ask the user what color pen they would like to draw with
    #      5) Use an if/else statement to set the pen color that the user
    #         requested
    #      6) If the user doesn't enter anything, choose a random color
    #      7) Put a loop around your code so that you keep asking the user for
    #         more colors & drawing them
